### Acceleration
* Python list $\rightarrow$ Numpy array
    * Implemented in C
* CPU
    * bandwidth (register size, how much data over time)
    * latency (time it takes)
    * throughput (amount of data)
* Complexity 
    * Compression (space complexity)
    * Acceleration (time complexity)
* Deep learning compiler
    * [Comprehensive Survey(2020)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.03794.pdf)
    * [딥러닝 컴파일러 성능비교(2019)](https://leejaymin.github.io/papers/dc18.pdf)

### Pruning
* 가지치기 (중요하지 않은 노드, 파라미터 제거)
* Iterative prunning
    * Remove the least important neuron
    * process
        * init model
        * apply mask to nodes/filters
        * train network until early stopping
        * apply prunning metric to choose a fraction p of nodes/filters

* Lottery ticket hypothesis ([ICLR 2019](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rJl-b3RcF7))
    * initialization lottery: their connections have initial weights that make training particularly effective.
    * Search for ticket
        * Iterative magnitude pruning
        * Iterative magnitude pruning with rewinding
